Have you ever played Terraria and wondered: "Where are the big burly men? Where is Billy Herrington? How come Steve can punch trees and I can't?"
Well look no further, for this is the mod for you.

Go through the various trials and tribulations that stand in your way and reach the pinnacle of male performance.
Work out, get gains! No longer are pickaxes, swords and bows needed! All you need is muscle, MUSCLE MAGIC.
Become the Alpha AND the Omega. 

Friendly reminder to not drop bodyparts.

(This mod also works if you're female: however, you run the risk of becoming an epic gamer)
